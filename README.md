# Soil Sensor Monitoring and Automation with ESP32 and Supabase

## Overview

This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to interface with a DFROBOT MODBUS-RTU RS485 Soil Sensor (SKU: SEN0602) for monitoring soil temperature, humidity, and pH levels. The sensor data is transmitted to a Supabase database, enabling real-time monitoring, CRUD operations, and control automation. This setup is ideal for agricultural applications requiring efficient and remote soil condition management.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Track soil temperature, humidity, and pH levels remotely.
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on sensor data stored in Supabase.
- **Automation:** Integrate with control systems for automated responses based on soil conditions.
- **Robust Design:** IP68-rated soil sensor for reliable performance in harsh environments.

## Components

- **ESP32 Microcontroller:** Handles sensor data processing and communication with Supabase.
- **DFROBOT MODBUS-RTU RS485 Soil Sensor (SKU: SEN0602):** Measures soil temperature, humidity, and pH.
- **Supabase Database:** Stores and manages the sensor data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP32 development board
- DFROBOT MODBUS-RTU RS485 Soil Sensor (SKU: SEN0602)
